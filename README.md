  ## ðŸš€ Quick start

  1.  **Setup this site.**

      Use the Gatsby CLI to Clone this site.

      ```sh
      # Clone this Repositories
      gatsby new your-project-name https://github.com/himali-patel/MyClicks
      ```

  1.  **Start developing.**

      Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

      ```sh
      cd MyClicks/
      gatsby develop
      ```

  1.  **Setup your Own Configure Projects.**

      Enter your own key

      [ContentFul](https://be.contentful.com/login):
      - spaceId = **Key**
      - accessToken = **Key**     


  1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

      Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

      _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
